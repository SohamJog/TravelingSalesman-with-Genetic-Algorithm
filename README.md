# TravelingSalesman-with-Genetic-Algorithm
A traveling salesman problem solver using the genetic algorithm. 
You'll need PyGame installed to run this program.

A simple fitness function has been used in this algorithm. I'm working on optimizing it to generate results faster with a large number of nodes. 

The picture shows a solution created by the algorithm. You can see the number of generations and the optimal distance at the top left corner.
